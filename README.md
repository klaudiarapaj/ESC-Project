# ESC-Project-

Software Engineering Project

I am planning to work individually as I will be turning this project into a graduation project.

Group/Project name: ESC (Epoka Student Community)
Group members: Klaudia Rapaj
Leader: Klaudia Rapaj

Problem: Students often find it difficult to reach out to each other, especially when they have no contacts with each other. Students of different departments and course programs struggle to find answers to common questions they might have because of inability to spread/communicate this information to others. Therefore, there is a need of a designed community for university's students to use in order to stay connected, help each other, grow network and make the most out of their university days.

Aim: Enhance the students' engagement and experience, solve student problems, motivate them into studying while having fun and staying connected.

Main objectives: Be able to build a dynamic and user-friendly web application for students to communicate and find a space where they can share their ideas related to anything about Epoka.\

Description of the application: A web application that merges features of reddit, twitter and slack in order to make it possible for students to have a variety of permissions to make posts, join groups and chat with students from any department, find materials or answers to their questions, search for already posted information, filter the content etc. The application with be specifically designed for Epoka students only therefore no one else will have access to it.
